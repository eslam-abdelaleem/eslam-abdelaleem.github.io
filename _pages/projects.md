### Grants & Funding

**2025**
:   **CoCo Pilot Grant** ($2,000)
    _Center of Excellence in Computational Cognition_
    Project: Tracking the Trajectory of Adaptation: A Deep Learning Approach to Dynamic Functional Connectivity.
    Funding supports an undergraduate researcher to deploy a deep learning-based Mutual Information Estimation framework for quantifying dynamic functional connectivity and network reorganization in high-density EEG recordings.

### Current Research

* **Dynamic Functional Connectivity:** Using deep learning to track network reorganization during adaptation (supported by the CoCo Pilot Grant).
* **NeuralMI:** A toolbox for rigorous mutual information estimation in neuroscience.
