I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Tech, advised by [Dr. Audrey Sederberg](https://sederberg-lab.org).

My research focuses on developing **principled, information-theoretic machine learning techniques** to extract meaningful representations from complex, high-dimensional data. I bridge computational neuroscience, statistical physics, and machine learning to uncover latent dynamical variables in neural recordings.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Physics at Emory University under [Dr. Ilya Nemenman](https://physics.emory.edu/faculty/nemenman/), where I worked on variational information bottlenecks.

### Current Research
* **Dynamic Functional Connectivity:** Using deep learning to track network reorganization during adaptation (supported by the CoCo Pilot Grant).
* **NeuralMI:** A toolbox for rigorous mutual information estimation in neuroscience.
