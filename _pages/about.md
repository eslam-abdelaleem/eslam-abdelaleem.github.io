**Salam, I'm Eslam.**

I am a physicist exploring the intersection of **neuroscience**, **statistical physics**, and **machine learning**.

My goal is simple: I try to find the simplicity (e.g., equations, patterns, etc.) hiding inside the complexity (e.g., brains!).

***

During my PhD at **Emory University** with [Dr. Ilya Nemenman](https://physics.emory.edu/people/bios/nemenman-ilya.html), I focused on a fundamental problem in modern science: we have too much data and not enough understanding.

I worked on **Dimensionality Reduction**, developing principled and information-theoretic, yet applicable using modern machine learning tools, frameworks to extract meaningful representations from large, multimodal datasets. Most of my work focused on the "Information Bottleneck Principle"—finding the sweet spot where we filter out the irrelevant -noise- but keep the variables that are actually relevant -signal- to the system.

Now, as a Postdoctoral Fellow at **Georgia Tech** working with [Dr. Audrey Sederberg](https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/audrey-sederberg), I am putting those theoretical tools to work on real neural circuits. My current work provides tools to bridge the gap between abstract machine learning models and the biological reality of how the brain processes information.

***

Aside from research, I don't just research physics; I love to teach it. I believe that if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.

Currently, I am a Lecturer for **Physics of Cognition** at Georgia Tech, a course that perfectly blends my two professional loves. There is nothing quite like the "aha!" moment when a student connects a complex equation to a real-world concept, which I try to include in every single lecture, assignment, or project.
