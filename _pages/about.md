My research develops principled, information-theoretic machine learning techniques to quantify and extract meaningful representations from complex, high-dimensional data. I specialize in creating novel methods to uncover latent dynamical variables in neural recordings and other empirical systems, bridging computational neuroscience, statistical physics, and machine learning.
